    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Onigiri, often referred to as Japanese rice balls, are a popular staple in
      Japanese cuisine known for their simplicity and versatility. These
      handheld snacks or light meals consist of sticky rice, usually seasoned
      with salt and sometimes vinegar, shaped into triangular or cylindrical
      forms. Onigiri often feature a filling at the center, such as pickled plum
      (umeboshi), grilled salmon, seaweed (nori), or other ingredients like tuna
      mayo or grilled chicken. The rice is typically wrapped in nori seaweed,
      which adds a contrasting texture and flavor. Onigiri are enjoyed as a
      quick snack, lunchbox item, or part of a casual meal, reflecting Japan's
      culinary tradition of combining rice with various fillings for portable
      and satisfying eating experiences.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>4 cups uncooked short-grain white rice</li>
      <li>5 ½ cups water, divided</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>¼ cup bonito shavings (dry fish flakes)</li>
      <li>2 sheets nori (dry seaweed), cut into 1/2-inch strips</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons sesame seeds</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Wash rice in a mesh strainer until water runs clear. Combine washed rice
        and 4 1/2 cups water in a saucepan. Bring to a boil over high heat,
        stirring occasionally. Reduce heat to low; cover, and simmer rice until
        water is absorbed, 15 to 20 minutes. Let rice rest for 15 minutes to
        continue to steam and become tender. Allow cooked rice to cool.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Combine remaining 1 cup water with salt in a small bowl; use to dampen
        hands before handling rice. Divide cooked rice into 8 equal portions.
        Use one portion of rice for each onigiri.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Divide one portion of rice in two. Create a dimple in rice and fill with
        a heaping teaspoon of bonito flakes. Cover with remaining portion of
        rice and press lightly to enclose filling inside rice ball. Gently press
        rice to shape into a triangle; wrap with a strip of nori and sprinkle
        with sesame seeds. Repeat with remaining portions of rice.
