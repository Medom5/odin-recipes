    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Lasagna is a classic Italian dish renowned for its layers of wide, flat
      pasta sheets alternated with rich and savory fillings. Typically, these
      fillings include a hearty combination of minced meat (such as beef, pork,
      or sausage), tomato sauce seasoned with herbs like basil and oregano,
      creamy b√©chamel sauce, and generous amounts of melted cheese, often
      mozzarella and Parmesan. The pasta sheets are boiled until tender, then
      layered with the sauces and cheeses in a baking dish before being baked in
      the oven until golden and bubbling. The result is a comforting and
      indulgent dish that melds together flavors and textures into a satisfying
      meal enjoyed worldwide.
